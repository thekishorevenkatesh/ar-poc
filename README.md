# AR Vision POC

A web-based AR proof of concept built with **React + TypeScript** that performs **real-time object detection** and **automatic vehicle make & model recognition**, displaying **stable AR labels** over detected vehicles.

## Features
- Live mobile camera AR
- Real-time object & vehicle detection
- Vehicle brand and model recognition
- Confidence smoothing across frames
- AR-anchored 3D labels
- Single web codebase (no app install)

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Three.js + React Three Fiber
- TensorFlow.js
- WebXR (optional)

## Notes
This is a web AR POC. Some advanced AR features (depth, occlusion) require native ARCore / ARKit.
